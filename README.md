# ContinuousBBO

This package is a collection of state of the art continuous black box problems:
- Unconstrained optimization
- Constrained optimization
- Multi-Objective optimization

It includes the BBOB, and different CEC test bench. Also, it includes some continuous black box problem generators based on gaussian compositions
